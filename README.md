 Private Repo for Joshua Terry

This is the private repo for Joshua Terry, Tufts '17 in Human Factors. It currently contains all the assignment and lab work for his Comp20: Web Programming course. 

My favorite assignment was assignment 3, creating a server was great way of understanding how site interactions work.

I've grown a strong amount, by largest growth has probably come in a) learning how ask the right questions, like when I had to alter questions on piazza from my specific instance of an error to understanding a high level topic and  b) evulating online help forums during the numerous times I looked at API documents that made no sense, but were well explain on stackoverflow forums.

Moving forward I think I'm going to continue to look into a front end and API development, I am incredibly interested in creating the interfaces users work with.
